## 6. Now push everything to GitHub

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "Add README, requirements, and gitignore"
```

```bash
git push origin main
```

## 7. Optional: Create a GitHub Actions workflow for deployment

```yaml:.github/workflows/streamlit-app.yml
name: Streamlit App

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2
      with:
        python-version: 3.9
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    - name: Test import
      run: |
        python -c "import streamlit; print('Streamlit installed successfully')"
```

## 8. Final steps

```bash
mkdir .github
mkdir .github/workflows
```

Then add the workflow file and push:

```bash
git add .
```

```bash
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
```

```bash
git push origin main
```
